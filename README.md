# J2019 Text Analysis

Some interesting insights and visualizations from four months' of writing. Inspired by simple curiosity about my writing habits.

Includes:
* a month by month graph of how many words written per day 
* a weekly distribution of word counts
* monthly heat maps of how frequently specific words occurred, in the four categories of "People," "Places," "Themes," and "Feelings"

Note: For my own future reference, I kept most of my rough work, hence why large chunks of code are commented out but not removed.
